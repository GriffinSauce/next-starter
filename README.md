# Next.js Starter

This is a slightly-opinionated starter kit to get Next.js projects off the ground quickly.

Get your project started quick with:

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Prettier formatting
- ESLint
- React Testing Library

Plus some handy extra's:

- Debug the server and client directly in VSCode
- Use `tailwindcss-class-combiner` to pass/override component CSS classes (see components/Logo)
- Light/dark theme support

## üí° Opinions

It might be worth reviewing the opinions/assumptions behind this starter kit:

- Some things are much more easily removed than correctly set up quickly (ie. linting, tests)
- Tailwind is the **only** way I want to style things
- TypeScript provides benefits even if you don't write any types
- Linting should be focused on mostly on errors and follow established best practices (hence: no eslint-unicorn)
- A global store is not included because it's often not needed and you should critically choose the right option (ie. maybe not redux)

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/project?template=https://github.com/GriffinSauce/next-starter)

## üöÄ Getting Started

Run the following command to create a new project with this Starter:

```
yarn create next-app my-app -e https://github.com/GriffinSauce/next-starter

# or

npx create-next-app my-app -e https://github.com/GriffinSauce/next-starter
```

Once the project and dependencies are finished installing, you can navigate to that directory and start up the development server with:

```
yarn dev

# or

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see your new project!

## üõ†Ô∏è Tooling

Some recommended tools:

- VSCode [PostCSS Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=csstools.postcss) to support Tailwind `@apply` statements in .css files
- VSCode [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) to get suggestions and linting
- VSCode [HeadWind](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=heybourn.headwind) to autosort Tailwind classes
- VSCode [Debugger For Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) to get client or server side debugging in your editor

Note: `.vscode/setting.json` is checked in, you probably want to add that to `.gitignore`.
